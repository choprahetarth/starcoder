All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing GPTBigCodeForCausalLM.

All the weights of GPTBigCodeForCausalLM were initialized from the model checkpoint at bigcode/starcoderbase-1b.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use GPTBigCodeForCausalLM for predictions without further training.
